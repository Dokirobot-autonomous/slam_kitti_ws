When launched by roslaunch, orb_mapping may be unable to save the map, 
especially for large ones. This is because roslaunch escalates signal to 
SIGTERM or even SIGKILL, when timeout is reached. The current solution is 
to modify the script:

/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/nodeprocess.py

Find the following line:
_TIMEOUT_SIGINT  = 15.0 #seconds
_TIMEOUT_SIGTERM = 2.0 #seconds

and change to any large values.
