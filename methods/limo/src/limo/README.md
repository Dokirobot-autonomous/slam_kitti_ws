Lidar-Monocular Visual Odometry.
This library is designed to be an open platform for visual odometry algortihm development.
We focus explicitely on the simple integration of the following key methodologies:

* Keyframe selection
* Landmark selection
* Prior estimation
* Depth integration from different sensors.
* Scale integration by groundplane constraint.

The core library keyframe_bundle_adjustment is a backend that should faciliate to swap these modules and easily develop those algorithms.

* It is supposed to be an add-on module to do temporal inference of the optimization graph in order to smooth the result
* In order to do that online a windowed approach is used
* Keyframes are instances in time which are used for the bundle adjustment, one keyframe may have several cameras (and therefore images) associated with it
* The selection of Keyframes tries to reduce the amount of redundant information while extending the time span covered by the optimization window to reduce drift
* Methodologies for Keyframe selection:
  * Difference in time
  * Difference in motion

* We use this library for combining Lidar with monocular vision.
* Limo2 on KITTI is LIDAR with monocular Visual Odometry, supported with groundplane constraint.

Please note that LIMO2 differs from the publication. 
We enhanced the speed a little and added additional groundplane reconstruction for pure monocular visual odometry and a combination of scale from LIDAR and the groundplane (best performing on KITTI).

## Installation

### Requirements

In any case:

* ceres: 
  - follow the instructions on [http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html)
  - you will need ```sudo make install``` to install the headers.
  - tested with libsuitesparse-dev from standard repos.
* png++: 
```shell
 sudo apt-get install libpng++-dev
 ```
* install ros: 
  - follow the instructions on [https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation).
  - you will need to install ros-full (for pcl).
  - don't forget to source your ~/.bashrc afterwards.
* install catkin_tools: 
```shell 
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
 ```
* install opencv_apps: 
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-opencv-apps
```
* install git: 
```shell
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Build

* initiate a catkin workspace:
    ```shell 
    cd ${your_catkin_workspace}
    catkin init
    ```

* clone limo into src of workspace:
    ```shell 
    mkdir ${your_catkin_workspace}/src
    cd ${your_catkin_workspace}/src
    git clone https://github.com/johannes-graeter/limo.git
    ```

* clone dependencies and build repos
    ```shell 
    cd ${your_catkin_workspace}/src/limo
    bash install_repos.sh
    ```

* unittests:
    ```shell 
    cd ${your_catkin_workspace}/src/limo
    catkin run_tests --this --profile limo_release
    ```
    
### Run
* get test data from [https://www.mrt.kit.edu/graeterweb/04.bag](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/graeterweb/04.bag)
    1. this is a bag file generated from Kitti sequence 04 with added semantic labels.
    2. there is more under the same address all named ??.bag (supported: 00.bag, 01.bag, 04.bag)

* in different terminals
    1. `roscore`
    2. `rosbag play 04.bag -r 0.1 --pause --clock`
    3. ```shell
       source ${your_catkin_workspace}/devel_limo_release/setup.sh
       roslaunch demo_keyframe_bundle_adjustment_meta kitti_standalone.launch
       ```
    4. unpause rosbag (hit space in terminal)
    5. `rviz ${your_catkin_workspace}/src/demo_keyframe_bundle_adjustment_meta/res/default.rviz`

* watch limo trace the trajectory in rviz :)

### Todo

* runtime is ok for individual modules, however communication between nodes must be enhanced to ensure online usage (nodelets...). 
* Make it overall faster.
* Test on our own test car.

### Try it out

If you just want to give it a quick peek, I prepared a ready-to-use virtualbox image (packed with Ubuntu 16.04.04, ros kinetic and all dependencies for limo).

* download it from [https://www.mrt.kit.edu/graeterweb/limo_full.ova](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/graeterweb/limo_full.ova).
* Password for the vm-image is "1234".
* Find all modules in ~/workspaces/limo/ .
* Run example (~/04.bag) as described above.
* Note that the runtime in the virtual machine is slower than on a normal system.
